This project required me to create a 4-5 page static website for a band (The Monkees).
This website is motivated by the brief given for the User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project and uses all the criteria supplied by "the client".
I used a mobile first approach and have made the site responsive.

## Known bugs
* Currently, the carousel used in library.html does not have an automatic feature that stops one video/audio from playing when play is pressed on the next video. In order to implement this I would need to use Jquery and as this is the User Centric Front End project I have chosen to omit this step.
* The "call to action" buttons do not go anywhere. This is because this is the User Centric Front End project.

## Built with
Mock ups built in: https://balsamiq.com/ (uploaded as a PDF file)
Html and CSS code written in: Cloud9
Web framework used: Bootstrap 3.3.7
Other resources used: Fontawesome, Googlefonts, Flexbox

## Versioning
I used Github for versioning on this project.

## Testing
Due to the nature of this project only a small amount of testing was required.
I did, however:
* Ran my code through a code checker (https://validator.w3.org/)
* Asked colleagues, friends and family to check this site and access from their own devices; any small changes were made and committed.
* Checked every feature worked (and looked consistent) in both Google Chrome and Internet Explorer 10.

## Acknowledgments/credits
* Antonija Šimić - mentor.
* Paul Lewis - colleague (Software Developer) who tested my finished site.
* Various family and friends - tested the site.
