This project required me to create a 4-5 page static website for a band (The Monkees).
This website is motivated by the brief given for the User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project and uses all the criteria supplied by "the client".
I used a mobile first approach and have made the site responsive; I achieved this mainly with the Bootstap grid system and media queries.

## Built with
* Mock ups built in: https://balsamiq.com/ (uploaded as PDF files)
* Html and CSS code written in: Cloud9
* Web framework used: Bootstrap 3.3.7
* Other resources used: Fontawesome, Googlefonts

## Versioning
I used Github for versioning on this project.

## Testing
The testing that I completed for this project is listed below:
* Ran my html code through a code checker (https://validator.w3.org/)
* Ran my css code through a code checker (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
* Asked colleagues, friends and family to check this site and access from their own devices; any small changes were made and committed.
* Checked every feature worked (and looked consistent) in both Google Chrome and Internet Explorer 10.
* Used https://www.responsinator.com to test how well the website responded to different device sizes.

## Acknowledgments/credits
* Antonija Šimić - mentor.
* Paul Lewis - colleague (Software Developer) who tested my finished site.
